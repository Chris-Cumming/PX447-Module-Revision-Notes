These revision notes are for the 3rd year module PX3A2: Quantum Physics of Atoms offered at the University of Warwick. They were made for use by the Warwick Physics Society as part of their revision guides and are based off my own revision notes. The original LaTeX template was downloaded from Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/mcmaster-thesis-example/bjccppctqwgt.
